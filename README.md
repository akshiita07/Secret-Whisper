# Secret-Whisper
It fetches and displays random secrets from an external API using Node.js, Express, and Axios, Whisper dynamically updates its UI with a new secret and its username upon each visit. Secrets are fetched asynchronously from an API endpoint and rendered in a minimalistic UI, encouraging users to explore random confessions anonymously shared by others.
